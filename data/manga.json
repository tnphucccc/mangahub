Out on the road he meets an extraordinary swordfighter with no name who is searching for a legendary master warrior. Bi-Kwang promises to aid the swordfighter if he lets Bi-Kwang meet his beautiful sister. Of course, it turns out the swordfighter is the sister, Hwa-Rin Dahm, and she must switch identities to keep the plot moving along. Bi-Kwang is immediately smitten, and thus we have a triangle involving only two people.\n\nThe story takes place in a setting in each side is trying to unify the Murim as a whole, and while this is taking place, Bi-Kwang who is extremely good at learning martial arts but doesn't want to learn it, gets into a deal where he takes the girl to see her grand father since he was the last person to see him before he disappeared and on the way he encounters many enemies and some friends (who show up from time to time) and he matures since he realizes why martial arts is so important and that he has been using it wrongly.

With the crisis averted, the Heroes returned to their home countries where they now help with domestic matters.\n___\n[Official X](https://x.com/SHY_off)\n\nFrom Yen Press:\nEarth was on the brink of a third World War when super-powered individuals came forth from each country around the globe, ending the conflict and ushering in a new era of relative peace.

They are responsible for providing the link between defense and offense, and controlling the tempo of the game through their passing. The regista is also known as the deep-lying playmaker: they retain their deep position and dictate their team's play with their distribution.

    "description": "**“—N-No!? Wolka, don’t die—!!”**\n\nWolka is an adventurer reincarnated from Japan. While exploring a dungeon, he and his party are attacked by an overwhelmingly powerful monster. In order to protect his companions, Wolka suffers critical injuries and is pushed to the brink of death.\n\nAt that very moment, he finally realizes the truth:\nThis world is the dark fantasy manga he once read in his previous life—and he himself is nothing more than a background character, fated to die along with the rest of the party.\n\nHating bad endings more than anything else, Wolka refuses to accept that fate. Driven by sheer desperation, he fights with everything he has and, against all odds, miraculously defeats the monster. Though he loses one eye and one leg in the process, Wolka feels relieved for having overturned the “party annihilation” ending that was supposed to await him.\n\nBut his troubles are far from over.\n\nSince that incident, the girls in his party begin to change.\nTheir gazes grow unbearably heavy.\nTheir words become increasingly dangerous.\n\n“I’ll protect you this time, so please don’t leave me...”\n“I’ll always stay by your side, senior—okay?”\n“I’ve already decided... if it’s for your sake, I’m ready to die.”\n\n\n\nThis is an isekai story about a reincarnator who believes in absolute happy endings—and the girls who harbor overwhelmingly obsessive feelings toward him.\nA darkly emotional otherworld tale themed around 【Emotional Descent】, where the survival he fought so desperately to achieve becomes the very beginning of emotional darkness.",

He will inherit the property of the noble Oshikouji family, but prefers practising Kendou. He enters a school for training Kendou swordman, but the seniors of school are very harsh and intolerable. But Ryu doesn't surrender and overcomes the problems, later on he impresses his seniors and they begin to like him.\n\nThis manga tells a great story against the richly textured background of historical Japan and China, it has a refined and excellent artwork. Murakami's views on Chinese and Korean people is very warm, and not those of the previous invader and governor such as the extreme right party in Japan. Another interesting part of the manga is its rich depiction of Japanese colorful life. A typical example of the realistic style and a manga of high reputation in Korea and Japan.",

    "description": "Takuya and Rika are co-workers for a travel agency and have barely ever interacted as they are both introverted, anti-social people. Both are doing their jobs as normal when an announcement from the higher-ups comes down: in one year, an overseas branch will be opening in Siberia, and an employee from their location will be sent to work there! While there's no telling who will be chosen to go, it is explained that people who are married and have families are far less likely to be sent! Neither Takuya nor Rika want to go to Siberia! Desperate to protect their solitary lives, they develop a plan: pretend that they are getting married to each other! Will they be able to keep up this charade for 365 days, and, maybe, even fall for one another in that time?",

She strives to correct that impression, but each day is another failure. However, while at the cinema to study horror films, she meets Seiichirou, a young man who is a huge fan of hasshakusama. That's when Yachiru realizes that whenever Seiichirou praises her, her height returns to its original size...!!!\n___\n**Additional Links:**\n- **Alt Official Raws:**\n  - [MagaPoke](https://pocket.shonenmagazine.com/title/02927/episode/420064)\n  - [niconico Manga](https://manga.nicovideo.jp/comic/73100)\n  - [YanMaga Web](https://yanmaga.jp/comics/%E3%82%84%E3%81%A1%E3%82%8B%E3%81%95%E3%82%93%E3%81%AF%E3%81%BB%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AE%E3%81%B3%E3%82%8B)\n- [Official X](https://x.com/yachirusanha)",

    "description": "At Seiryo High School, where second-year student Minato Ichijo attends, there is a girl known as the “Cold Princess.” Her name is Rei Nanase. With her stunning beauty and exceptional talents, many admire her—yet she rejects all advances with an icy attitude. Minato, however, has little interest in romance due to personal reasons. Even though Rei sits next to him in class and works part-time at the same café, he pays her no special attention. One day, Minato stumbles upon Rei in a back alley, quarreling with a persistent man he recognizes as a customer who had been turned down by her at the café. Acting on impulse, he steps in to help. The very next day after work, Rei unexpectedly appears in the staff room—despite not being scheduled—and suddenly demands a kiss from Minato… Thus begins Minato’s bewildering days, swept up by a slightly offbeat kuudere young lady.",
