## Regulations on AI Chatbot Usage

### 1. Permitted Uses
- AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) may be used for **idea brainstorming, language refinement, grammar checking, and summarization**.
- Students may use AI to explore programming approaches, but **final implementation must be their own**.

### 2. Prohibited Uses
- Submitting AI-generated code, documentation, or reports **without meaningful modification** is strictly prohibited.
- Using AI to solve entire project tasks or bypass the learning objectives will be treated as **academic misconduct**.

### 3. Transparency
- Students must **acknowledge in the report** if AI tools were used, including a brief description of how they were applied.

### 4. Responsibility
- The student team bears **full responsibility** for the accuracy, originality, and ethical use of any AI-assisted content.
- Any violation of this policy will result in penalties in accordance with the university's academic integrity code.

## Examples of Acceptable AI Usage

Students may refer to the following examples as guidance for responsible AI usage:

- **Brainstorming Ideas**: Using AI to suggest potential project structures or approaches, then critically evaluating and modifying them.
- **Language Support**: Asking AI to refine grammar, spelling, or clarity in reports, while ensuring the technical content is student-generated.
- **Summarization**: Using AI to summarize research papers or documentation, followed by student verification and deeper reading.
- **Code Assistance**: Requesting AI to explain syntax errors or give pseudocode examples, but writing and testing the actual implementation independently.
- **Learning Aid**: Using AI to clarify complex concepts (e.g., gRPC, concurrency, WebSocket handling) as a study guide, not as final deliverables.

⚠️ **Note**: Any AI-generated content must be acknowledged and reviewed by the student. Blindly copying AI output into deliverables is not acceptable.
